Server needs to: 
	Receive uploaded video
	Process requested resource
	List resources that are in the cloud
	Give out detailed information about resources it has
	Give out thumbnails of resources

(by resource I mean video clip. In future this could be archive of videos, pictures, a link to resources at some other place, etc.)

1. Receive uploaded video
	LOCATION:
		/UploadResource
	INPUT:
		multipart request that has 1 video file in it
	OUTPUT:
		Could be that it takes too much time to calculate all those values, then there are 2 options: 1) replace unknown fields with string N/A 2) just return a resouceID
		JSON describing uploaded resource. In the form of:
		{
			ID : <string>, # only condition is that it should be unique (could use good old MD5)
			title : <string>, # possibly read title from media file. could be left empty
			fileName : <string>,
			size : <double>, # bytes
			duration : <double> # seconds
		}

2. Process requested resource
	LOCATION:
		/ProcessResources
	INPUT:
		JSON list of resourceID's
		resources : ["ID123","ID124"]
	OUTPUT:
		Status object (JSON) describing what is happening with the request
		{
			statusCode : <string>, # short string like STARTED,PROCESSING,FINISHED,ERROR
			statusDescription : <string> # could be longer string explaining status code
		}

3. List resources that are in the cloud
	LOCATION:
		/ListResources
	INPUT:
		nothing
	OUTPUT:
		JSON list of resources
		[
			{
				ID : <string>,
				title : <string>,
				fileName : <string>,
				size : <double>,
				duration : <double>
			},
			{
				ID : <string>,
				title : <string>,
				fileName : <string>,
				size : <double>,
				duration : <double>
			}
		]

4. Give out detailed information about resources it has
	LOCATION:
		/ResourceDetails
	INPUT:
		Post request with 1 parameter(key/value) : resourceID : <string>
	OUTPUT:
		JSON string with media resource description
		{
			ID : <string>,
			title : <string>,
			fileName : <string>,
			size : <double>,
			duration : <double>
		}

5. Give out thumbnails of resources
	LOCATION:
		/ResourceThumbnails
	INPUT:
		Post request with 1 parameter(key/value): resourceID:<string>
	OUTPUT:
